# Worklog for implementing tailwind


The point here is to
change the CSS in `fresh` template
to use [Tailwind][tailwind] framework.
Why?

- to try it out
- to see if going from an established
  CSS framework to another is possible
- all the cool kids are using it


## Plan

All this work is off of the branch `tailwind`.
First, we'll just play with this branching
model by putting this document in
`tailwind/main`.
