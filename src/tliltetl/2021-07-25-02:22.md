title: when you went into someone's house
summary: when you went into someone's house
---

when you went into someone's house
one of the things you'd do
was too look at their music collection
which albums were arranged near the turntable & whether they were stacked flat or on edge told you something about three kind of person
the kinds of albums
specific universal releases
everyone had some talking heads and rem 
and it meant something
there was an article that started a story of someone ending a friendship
over an album

and then CDs 
you could do the same
though it felt different
